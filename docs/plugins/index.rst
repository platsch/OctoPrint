Starting with OctoPrint 1.2.0, there's now a plugin system in place which allows to individually
extend OctoPrint's functionality.

Right now plugins can be used to extend OctoPrint's web interface, to execute specific tasks on server startup and
shutdown, to provide custom (API) endpoints with special functionality, to react on system events or to add support for
additional slicers. More plugin types are planned for the future.
