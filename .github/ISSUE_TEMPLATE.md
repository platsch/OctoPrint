This is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs
or request features within OctoPrint (not OctoPi, not any OctoPrint
plugins and not unofficial OctoPrint versions). Mark requests with
a [Request] prefix in the title please. Fully fill out the bug reporting
template for bug reports.

Do not seek support here ("I need help with ..."), that belongs on
the mailing list or the G+ community (both linked in the "guidelines
for contributing" linked above, read it!), NOT here.

Thank you!
